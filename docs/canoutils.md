# Canoutils

CanoUtils is technically unrelated to the Cano text editor, but it is built by several members of the Cano community. Initially started by [proh14](https://github.com/proh14), CanoUtils is a reimplementation of the Unix core utils written in C. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/proh14/canoutils).
